[Python Style Guide - Python Enhancement Proposal 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

## Proposal

---

An application which can take an editable list of items and supply a list of recipes for those items

## App Features:

---

### Checklist of staple ingredients

Instead of having to add garlic, ginger, salt, pepper, etc. This will be a quick yes/no list for those ingredients

### Editable list of ingredients

This will be stored as a csv, with options to add, remove, view, clear. It will store the main ingredients, ie. protein, vegetables, etc.

### Fetch a list of recipes via API

The list of recipes from an external source

### Export recipe from CLI to hopefully a PDF.

Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:

-   use of variables and the concept of variable scope
-   loops and conditional control structures
-   error handling

Consult with your educator to check your features are sufficient .

### Spell check

The application will speck check inputs to ensure that an item can be returned

## Help documentation

Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

You must include:

-   steps to install the application
-   any dependencies required by the application to operate
-   any system/hardware requirements
-   how to use any command line arguments made for the application
